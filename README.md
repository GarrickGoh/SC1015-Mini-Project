# SC1015-Mini-Project
This is a Mini Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligience) my group and I will be focusing on the availibility of carpark. Based on the user input of destination and time, find the best carpark for the user to go, based on the available lots. (For purpose of this project, we will be focusing on the selected 10 carparks in the Jurong Area)
1. Data extraction: Web Scraping from https://data.gov.sg/dataset/carpark-availability for carpark availibility
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Machine Learning

# Problem Definition
* Are we able to predict the availibility of the carpark based on previous years analysis?
* Which model is better for predicting the lots availibility.

# Models Used
* Arima
* Decision Tree Regressor
* Random Forest Regression

# Codes
## Jupyter Notebook 1 Exploratory Data Analysis
Here we will be touching on the analysis of the 10 carparks and show the availibility of lots over the years. We will be taking a look at the average lots availibility as well as the space used and there will be graphs to showcase the information. There is also a timegraph to show the information over the years and an analysis of a weekly timegraph to see in depth the lots availibility.
## Jupyter Notebook 2 Machine Learning
## Jupyter Notebook 3 

# Conclusion 
* Easier to find lots at off-peak hour when people drive to work 
* Try to avoid the largest carpark. More lots, more people going to park there.

# Learning Points From The Project
* Web Scraping and making requests from an API
* More unique ways to present EDA
* Working on Github as a group
